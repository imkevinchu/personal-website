Personal website built with [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). Blog posts are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com).

## Getting started

First install the npm dependencies:

```
npm install
```

The `.env.local` file in the project root contains the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` variable to the site's public URL:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

Next, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.
